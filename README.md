  Use any front-end framework you like. No back-end server should be necessary except as a file server. You can use a builder to bootstrap application:
  [X] React's create-react-app https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
    Angular CLI https://github.com/angular/angular-cli
    Ember CLI https://ember-cli.com/
    Vue CLI https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli
  Others are fine if you are proficient.

  CSS Frameworks: It is preferred that you do not use a framework. Focus more on functionality, use native HTML tags, and apply minimal CSS where necessary.
  You may run into an issue with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). If you are using Google Chrome, you can use a browser extension such as https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc


SUMMERY

I used create-react-app for my front-end framework, and axios for the api calls.
did not apply css styles to result items, ran out of time. I used localStorage to save meals data for planning feature. normally wound not do this and save this to an api. In sprit of the challenge to make a front-end used localStorage as a substitute.

Directions:
npm install
npm run start
